        <p>Herbal medicines are those with active ingredients made from plant parts, such as leaves, roots or flowers. But being "natural" doesn't necessarily mean they're safe for you to take. Just like conventional medicines, herbal medicines will have an effect on the body, and can be potentially harmful if not used correctly.Plant-based products used to treat diseases or to maintain health, are called herbal products, botanical products, or phytomedicines. A product made from plant sources and used only for internal use is called an herbal supplement.</p>
